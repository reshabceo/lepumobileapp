# Testing SDK Initialization and Permission Fixes

## What We Fixed

1. **Manual SDK Initialization Issue**: Previously, the SDK had to be manually initialized. Now it should initialize automatically on app launch.

2. **Missing Permission Requests**: Previously, Bluetooth permissions were not being requested on first app launch. Now permissions should be requested automatically.

3. **State Persistence**: Device connection state should now persist when navigating between different screens.

## Testing Steps

### 1. First Launch Test
1. **Uninstall the app** from your device completely
2. **Install the new APK** (already done)
3. **Launch the app for the first time**
4. **Expected Behavior**: 
   - App should automatically request Bluetooth permissions
   - You should see permission dialogs for:
     - Bluetooth Scan
     - Bluetooth Connect  
     - Location (required for BLE scanning)
   - SDK should initialize automatically after permissions are granted

### 2. Permission Granting Test
1. **Grant all requested permissions** when prompted
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - App should show "SDK initialized successfully" or similar message
   - Bluetooth should be enabled automatically
   - No manual initialization should be required

### 3. Device Connection Test
1. **Go to Wellue Scanner** screen
2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Should show "SDK initialized" status
   - Should be able to scan for devices without manual initialization
   - Connect to your BP device

### 4. State Persistence Test
1. **After connecting device in Wellue Scanner**
2. **Navigate to Live BP Monitor**
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Should NOT go back to device scanning
   - Should show the connected device
   - Should be ready for BP measurements

### 5. Manual Initialization Fallback Test
1. **If permissions are denied initially**:
   - App should show "Initialize SDK" button
   - Click the button
   - Should request permissions again
   - Should initialize successfully after permissions granted

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Permissions requested automatically on first launch
- SDK initializes without manual intervention
- Bluetooth enabled automatically
- Device connection state persists across screens
- No "SDK not initialized" errors

### ‚ùå Problem Indicators
- No permission dialogs on first launch
- "SDK not initialized" messages
- Manual initialization button appears
- Device connection lost when navigating between screens
- Bluetooth not enabled automatically

## Troubleshooting

### If Permissions Still Not Requested
1. Check device settings for the app
2. Ensure app has permission to request permissions
3. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app

### If SDK Still Not Auto-Initializing
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify all permissions are granted
3. Try the manual initialization button

### If State Still Not Persisting
1. Check that DeviceContext is properly wrapping the app
2. Verify device connection is maintained in Wellue Scanner
3. Check console for any error messages

## Console Logs to Monitor

Look for these log messages in your development console:

```
‚úÖ Wellue SDK initialized successfully
üîÑ SDK initialization pending permissions - will retry on user action
‚úÖ SDK initialized during scan start
‚úÖ Manual SDK initialization successful
```

## Report Back

Please test these scenarios and let me know:

1. **Are permissions being requested automatically on first launch?**
2. **Is the SDK initializing automatically after permissions are granted?**
3. **Is Bluetooth being enabled automatically?**
4. **Does device connection state persist when navigating between screens?**
5. **Are there any error messages or unexpected behaviors?**

This will help us verify that all the fixes are working correctly!
